'''what is the equation to convert height front FT to m? 
what is the eaqution to convert weight from LB to Kg? '''
#lb =  input('I weigh ' + 'lbs.')
#inches = input('I am ' + 'inches tall.')
#looking to print the question? how much do you weight and have the user inout the answer and it print as a string and int. ie, i weight x lbs
inches = int(input("Hey American, enter your height in inches: "))
lb = int(input("Wow thats short(thats what she said), now enter your weight in lbs: "))
m = inches / 39.37
kg = lb / 2.205

# Was trying to display the following: Your weight is x in kg but im unsuccessful because its going to print out a string and an int. gotta learn how to do that

#Answer: type cast the int() to a str()
print("This is your height in " + str(m))
# currently running test 
 # Success!(building blocks baby)

print("This is your height in " + str(kg))

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
