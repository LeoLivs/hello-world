# hello-world
The following is my first open repository, keep scrolling and enjoy!
I love music, sound and all things in between. I'm a DJ with 8 years experience, a sterile processing technician for 7 years and I'm learning the real estate investing system right now. 
Tech has always been a great interest of mine. I remember applying to Best Buy(got to the third interview), hating Apple then getting an Apple Touch and falling in love with the company. Fun Fact: I used to buy HDMI cords off of Monoprice.com and sell them. Ssshhhhh don't tell em tho.
